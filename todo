Gaze Contingency

- documentation on parameters on info fed to the calibration27

- try throwing:

gaze_out_of_bounds
calibrate_using_2_7
calibration_test
setup_et

functions into cfin_psychoLink.py similar to ET_functions in retinostim.


disable pixelmode on recalibration

- fix so buttons are there when calibration dot appears, and at validation / or continue
- fix so head is first camera image. (press enter)


-test  calibrate_eyelink_2_7  using  cfin_psychoLink
- test cfin_psychoLink in general.

- remove psycholinkHax, Laurits, 27, 37.

- test new example_gc_flash

- remove user/experimenter, just have "c", be able to change
        - Done test removal of ahk
        - Done test global cleanup
        - document global cleanup.


-  complete write_MEG trigger shooting

- test that EDF is saved when global key is used to quit.
- test that EDF is saved when performing recalibration mid session.


- do i need to close the file to recalibrate, closing and recalibration, and saving. test that all data is there.
- colorspace, test using different colorspaces than rgb255.
- maybe fix so color space is recalculated if its "rgb" only
