Description:
This script features an implementation of gaze-contingent eyetracking for designed to run at the MEG
Lab at CFIN Nord (Skejby) (Aarhus University).
It uses Python with the packages Psychopy for stimuluation, and uses the psycholink scripts
(https://github.com/jonathanvanleeuwen/psychoLink) # from Jan 17, 2020
which is a gaze contingent package for the 1000hz eyelink eyetracker compatible with psychopy.

Gaze Contingency is usefull if want to present stimuli dependent on where the participant is looking, like for example
a fixation cross. The example in this script is based of the double flash experiment
(https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/23407974/) where a white disk is presented in the
periphery of the participants visual field, while (ideally) the participant is remaining their gaze on
a central fixation cross. To ensure that this is actually the case, one can use the eyetracker to ask just before
the presentation whether the participant is actually looking at the fixation cross.
In the psycholink function "waitForFixation", the eyetracker waits until the participants gaze is within a certain
amount of degrees of the fixation cross, for a variable amount of time. If it is not within (i.e. the participant is
not looking at the fixation cross), some white circles appear around the cross, reminding the participant
to look at the cross.

(in my oppinion) The psycholink scripts are not fully developed to handle the situation where the eyetracker needs to
be calibrated "midway" or during the experiment. Therefore this example experiment script was developed along
with some wrapper functions (see "DEFINITIONS" further below for those), to handle the instance
where a re-calibration would be required.

(I've also disabled some uses of the psycholink script that takes a tkinter.filedialog for inputting participant infor
mation, which didnt work and caused import errors.)

Furthermore, the psycholink package requires that you press keyboard inputs like "space"  "c", and "enter", while
calibrating the eyetracker. At the MEG lab at skejby, this would require that you are outside of the
Magnetically Shielded Room (MSR) while calibrating. This is quite a hassle compared to being able to calibrate the
eyetracker while inside the MSR, where you can 1. adjust the eyetracker to make the calibration more smooth,
2. better instruct the participant during the setup before the calibration, 3. potentially calibrate the eyetracker
just before you yourself act as a participant for testing purposes. For those reasons I made a "hack" called
"waitForfixation" which I adopted from the psycholink "waitForFixation" function.

Some wrapper functions are also created that setup the ET, along with saving of eyetracking data.
The script also features some examples of how to make triggers (epochs) in the eyetracking data based on
the stimulation or behavior of the participant, and the example can be a good guide for eyetracking in general
even without gaze contingency.

The script has been tested at the MEG lab at Skejby by Timo Kvamme & Chris Bailey on the 20/10/2020
IMPORTANT: Eyetracking is difficult - It is therefore critical that you test the calibration and the
saving of data (check triggers) before use.

Psycholink has been written for python version 2.7, however it is possible to use run python 3.6 or higher.
This can be achived by using 2.7 to calibrate the eyetracker and switch to 3.6 once calibration has been performed.
This is how it is currently, although in the future we might make this simpler.

recalbration during the experiment is possible in alot of ways.
First a recalibrationkey is set. default is "c" in this script.

1. If this is pressed while the participant gets the prompt that they were not attending to fixation cross,
recalibration will start (Although you will need to press it before the particpant presses 3 (the default continue key))

2. Currently in this script, if the recalibration key is pressed during collection of responses
i.e. when the particpant is deciding how many flashes they saw, as part of the paradigm (recalibration starts).

3. You can also opt to change this line:
etFixProtocolPath = os.getcwd() + "\etFixProtocol.txt"
This is only necessary, if you are generally not faster than your participant in pressing the recalibration key.

if this path was to be changed to a location on the network. (check access to the network when the stimpc is booted)
you could save the etFixProtocol.txt on the network.

During every attempt fixation test, it tests if "etFixProcol" is set to "user" or "expr"
if you use another computer, say you're own laptop, and change the content's of the txt file from the default user
to "expr". it means that when the particpant is asked to refocus, you have control over what happens, are they
allowed to try again, or do you want to perform a recalibration, driftcorrect, or continue without GC.
this is particular usefull if you are dealing with a participant where you are concerned that they can't focus
that particularly well on the fixation cross, or issues with eyetracking collection, like wearing glasses.

you could also set the default procedure to "expr", when editing this line:
defaultReFixationProtocol = "user"
althought that would mean that if the participant isn't looking at the fixation cross, you need to be present
to continue, recalibrate, driftcorrect or continue without gc, if they are unattentive for a moment
(which just me, will happen). I.e. sometimes participants just need an extra change, other times, the ET
needs to recalibrate.

# during this time however, you can also press "C". Which will also force etFixation protocol to change to "expr"

# this means that the only thing you need to do at outside the MSR during calibration, is to press on the participants
# eye, with the mouse on the eyetracking PC. This is done after the participants head is fully in the helmet,
# and you have asked them that they are sitting comfortably (i.e in a position they can sit for ~1 hour).

#Important to remeber is to have the light conditions (amount of light) / (close the door)
# to be the same when you calibrate and use auto threshold as how it is when you run the experiment.
