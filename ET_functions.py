# core eyetracking settings:

ETtest = True
ET = True # whether to collect ET data
ETGC = True # whether to make stimulus presentation Gaze contingent, i.e dependent on the eye-gaze position.
# it is a good idea to have it as a variable, that potentially can be turned off, if for some reason it causes problems
ETCalibration =True # whether to calibrate, if false it's assumed the ET has already been calibrated sufficiently
calculateFPS = False # Calculate your own fps or use default


# eyetracking gaze contingency settings:

etMaxDist = 3.0 # the max distance (in degrees) gaze should be from fixation cross before participant is instructed to refixate
etMaxWait = 4.0 #The maximum time to wait for a correct fixation before prompting the user about refixation. In seconds.
etNRings= 3 # The number of rings to use for constricting circles, that help the participant refixate on the cross
etFixTime=200 # The duration of contiguous samples within the boundary that are required for successful fixation.
# (the eyelink has a default 1000hz sampling rate, so 200 = 200ms of data).
# for testing purposes you can turn this up, so you can see the GC in action
refocusingTime = 0.800 # in seconds.  following a "refocusing" scenario, where the participant was inattentive,
# and the rings appear, its a good idea to add some time before paradigm-relevant stimuli is presented.
# during a "user" outcome, i.e when the the participant has not looked at the fixation cross (due to inattention)
# or due to the eyetracker not being calibrated probably, (maybe they changed position).

# the participant can then press (3), "green" button. to retry fixation.
# during this time however, you can also press "C". Which will also force recalibration.
# this uses the psychopy function event.globalKeys


# eyetracking display settings (for calibration):

fixHeight = 1.5
gazeDotRadius = 0.3

# eyetracking calibration settings:

Recalibrate = False # initiation of variable
testCalibration = True # whether to test the calibration right after, which shows a GC red dot. Highly recommended.
# if it looks bad, i.e the dot is flickering, you can press escape (tripple click red button)
# to retry the calibration.
calibrateTestTime = 5 # in seconds. After calibration, how long should you test the calibration. Gives you some time
# to evaluate the calibration, and to potentially retry it.
interpreter_python27 = 'C:/Program Files (x86)/PsychoPy2/python.exe'

# During the calibration proceedure, a small script is started that capture
# the response box inputs and redirects it for the input used by psycholink.
# this is to allow for the possibility of more than one button press.

# (alternatively you could make a hack to the psycholink script itself)

# the script allows the following responsebox presses to lead to control the psycholink interface
# Eye tracking Cheat Sheet

# (1) Red one tap = Space
# (1) Red two taps = Enter
# (1) Red three taps = Escape

# (2) Blue = LEFT - change image
# (3) Yellow = a – auto threshold
# (4) Green = c – calibrate
# (4) Green two taps = v - validate



# this means that the only thing you need to do at outside the MSR during calibration, is to press on the participants
# eye, with the mouse on the eyetracking PC. This is done after the participants head is fully in the helmet,
# and you have asked them that they are sitting comfortably (i.e in a position they can sit for ~1 hour).

#Important to remeber is to have the light conditions (amount of light) / (close the door)
# to be the same when you calibrate and use auto threshold as how it is when you run the experiment.
# the auto-threshold and eyetracking in general is very senitive to light.
